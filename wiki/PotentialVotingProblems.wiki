= Introduction =

There are some things that can disrupt the plugin's regular functioning. All these problems are caused by something outside the plugin. Here is the list of such problems.

*Before you report a bug, please check all on this list.*

= List of problems =

  * *Server Configuration*: in few instances css files used by the plugin were not loaded because of the server error (Error code 500). This is usually problem with server access rights or some other configuration problem.

  * *Invalid WordPress Theme*: in many cases problem is theme used. Some themes don;t follow design specifications, and missing some important elements and calls as wp_head() or some other, and because of that CSS and JS files used by the plugin fail to load.

  * *jQuery not loaded*: plugin requires jQuery for AJAX voting and it must be loaded. Plugin adds jQuery for load, but in some special cases jQuery doesn't load. Check the theme or some other WordPress settings nad even plugins that could interfere with jQuery loading.

  * *Posts generated by FeedWordPress plugin*: this plugin uses a filter hook to render the posts, and no other filters are used. I have notified plugin author to fix it, but that't not done yet.

  * *Other plugins JavaScript code*: many plugin use JavaScript, but in many cases this code is poorly written and it breaks the JavaScript execution. This could be regular JavaScript or jQuery. The solution is to determine which plugin is causing problems by disabling all active plugins on you blog, one by one.

  * *Cross-domain ajax execution*: I have noticed that some hosting companies use redirecting and rewriting for domains. So your domain is *www.mydomain.com*, but your actual address behind it is *www.hostingcompany.com/mydomain*. This is than considered cross-domain ajax call, and browsers don't allow it. There are ways to override it, but I am not going to add any code to do that, so don't ask.

  * *WordPress older than 2.5*: Some people are trying plugin with WordPress 2.3 or even earlier. But, as the readme file says, plugin require WordPress 2.5 minimum.

  * *Plugin Settings*: Some voting problems are connected to invalid settings. You should check plugin settings after every update, because I offten update this, add new settings and also remove some of them.

  * *Cookies*: by default plugin is set to use cookies to prevent duplicate voting. And because of that you can't vote twice for the same post. Some people report that as a bug. It's not a bug, check your settings!

= MS Internet Explorer only problems =

  * *Use of BASE tag*: this tag goes into header, and modifies the target and URL for all A tags on the page. If you set target to blank, all links will open in new windows. Each rating star is A tag, and this will cause the problem. Rating will work fine, but a new page will be opened with a JS call, and that will generate error. Remove this BASE tag on your blog if you have such problems. I will try to make some kind of override in future versions.

  * *Use of Wp-UnitPNGfix plugin*: this will effect ONLY IE6 browsers. There is no workaround for this because this plugin implements a PNG fix I found to be much worse than the fix I included with the plugin. None of the existing fixes can't solve all IE6 PNG transparency problem, but this plugin will cause rating plugin to render stars invalid.
