= Introduction =

There are some things that can disrupt the plugin's regular functioning. All these problems are caused by something outside the plugin. Here is the list of such problems.

*Before you report a bug, please check all on this list.*

= List of problems =

  * *Posts generated by FeedWordPress plugin*: this plugin uses a filter hook to render the posts, and no other filters are used. I have notified plugin author to fix it, but that't not done yet.

  * *Other plugins JavaScript code*: many plugin use JavaScript, but in many cases this code is poorly written and it breaks the JavaScript execution. This could be regular JavaScript or jQuery. The solution is to determine which plugin is causing problems by disabling all active plugins on you blog, one by one.

  * *Cross-domain ajax execution*: I have noticed that some hosting companies use redirecting and rewriting for domains. So your domain is *www.mydomain.com*, but your actual address behind it is *www.hostingcompany.com/mydomain*. This is than considered cross-domain ajax call, and browsers don't allow it. There are ways to override it, but I am not going to add any code to do that, so don't ask.

  * *WordPress older than 2.5*: Some people are trying plugin with WordPress 2.3 or even earlier. But, as the readme file says, plugin require WordPress 2.5 minimum.

  * *Plugin Settings*: Some voting problems are connected to invalid settings. You should check plugin settings after every update, because I offten update this, add new settings and also remove some of them.
