#summary List of potential problems.

= Introduction =

There are some things that can disrupt the plugin functioning. Here is the list.

= List of problems =

  * *Posts generated by FeedWordPress plugin*: this plugin uses a filter hook to render the posts, and no other filters are used. I have notified plugin author to fix it, but that't not done yet.
  * *Other plugins JavaScript code*: many plugin use JavaScript, but in many cases this code is poorly written and it breaks the JavaScript execution. THis could be regular JavaScript or jQuery. The solution is to determine which plugin is causing problems by disabling all active plugins on you blog, one by one.
