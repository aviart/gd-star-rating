== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to check if there is a simple and already explained solution to my problem? =
Check the post in the following category: http://www.gdstarrating.com/category/tutorials/solving-problems/.

= How to change visibiliy of plugin menus to different user levels? =
This is controled by the constants defined in the config files. Detailed info on setting them is here: http://www.gdstarrating.com/2009/08/12/using-config-files/.

= How to insert rating blocks or results directly into the theme files? =
All plugins functions for inserting wherever you want can be found in the info folder included with the plugin, or at this url: http://info.dev4press.com/gd-star-rating/.

= How to change the elements displayed by the plugin in widget, rating blocks and other rendering elements? =
All rendering is controled by the T2 templates system. To change the rendering output you need to make your own templates and change what they display.

= Plugin is not showing rating stars or rating widgets after update? =
Check all plugin and plugins widgets settings after update and save them.

= I have added one of the plugins widgets, and it's not showing anything? =
Check the widget settings. Most likely problem is with default widget setting to show only posts with 5 votes or more. If you have just set the plugin most likely you still don't have enough votes.
